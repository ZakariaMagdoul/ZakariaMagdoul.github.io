A customisable and interactive Python simulation build over PyGame that models the orbits of celestial bodies in 2D space using Newton’s law of universal gravitation!

This simulation allows users to choose from several included preset arrangements or create a simulation configuration from scratch.

Precise positioning and movement vectors are obtained through built-in access to JPL’s HORIZONS system, a resource that provides precise data for objects in our solar system.


## Tech stack

**Python** 
- **Pygame** for simulation animation
- **Astropy** for computations and access to the JPL Horizons database
